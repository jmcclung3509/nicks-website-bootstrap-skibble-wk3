                    <p>Listen to the sound of the waves rolling on the beaches’ edge. Hear the seagulls as they seem to
                        float in the wind and play amid the glittering white water. Watch and wonder at the grace of the
                        pelicans as they dive. Then sit and sense the calmness that this beautiful cove, Rockaway beach,
                        gives to its visitors. It is no wonder that this cove brought a man from thousands of miles away
                        to make it his home.</p>

                    <p> Stalios Karagianis was in 1886 in Macedonia, Greece. At the age of twenty, Karagianis boarded a
                        ship called the Konstantinos and set off for America. He landed in New York, and then made his
                        way across the country to San Francisco. Upon his arrival in the City by the Bay, his first
                        order of business was to find work. In those early years, he worked a number of jobs including
                        at a vegetable store, as a jitney driver, and then as a laborer on the Ocean Shore Railroad,
                        which brought him to the beautiful Pacifica coastside. Following his work on the railroad,
                        Karagianis moved back to San Francisco to work in a glass factory, and ultimately became a
                        building contractor.</p>
                    <figure class="text-center">
                        <img src="../images/history-one.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="rockaway cafe">
                    </figure>
                    <p>It was during this time that Karagianis sent for his wife Anastasia to join him. A house was
                        built in Daly City, and soon the family home was filled with children, three older daughters
                        followed by one son.
                        In 1927, Karagianis returned to the coast and bought a piece of property on the water’s edge
                        here at Rockaway Beach. A business was built selling sandwiches, peanuts and candy to fishermen
                        and beach goers. Tragically, upon arriving for work one morning Karagianis found his business
                        burnt to the ground. He proceeded to rebuild, and it wasn’t long before he was back in business;
                        however, fire soon struck again. No one can really say what inspired him to rebuild a third
                        time, but he reopened to serve those who visited beautiful Rockaway Beach. In the years that
                        followed, the family moved to Pacifica, residing at the business, and making Rockaway their
                        home.
                        Years passed and Karagianis found the patrons and visitors to Rockaway Beach often had trouble
                        pronouncing his name. He eventually changed his name to Charles Gust. Friends and customers
                        would travel narrow roads and many miles just to visit the Greek at Rockaway Beach, Charlie
                        Gust. </p>
                    <figure class="text-center">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Charlie has passed on, but he lived to see his small Rockaway stop become one of the most unique
                        and pleasurable dining spots along the Pacific Coast. Charlie’s persistence in always improving
                        and expanding his business still lingers on, as one can see. Serving the public was his goal,
                        and we hope to carry it on for a long time to come.
                        What Charles and his family saw many years ago still goes on at Rockaway Beach. That calm,
                        relaxed atmosphere calls to those who enjoy the beautiful coast. The gracious hospitality
                        Charles expressed and the utmost in fine dining is still maintained by Charlie’s family. In the
                        tradition he originated many years ago. This restaurant is a tribute we make to Charles Gust by
                        having you dine where dining is at his best.
                        The Gust family welcomes you to Rockaway Beach on the shores of the beautiful Pacific Ocean, in
                        Pacifica, California.</p>
                    <p>Our Best Wishes, </p>
                    <p class="names"> Charles, Anastasia, Nick, Lorraine, Kathy, Chuck and Lena.</p>
